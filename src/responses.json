Set in postwar Berlin, the allegorical scene features Beckmann as a man on his way home who suddenly encounters a horribly disfigured veteran under the light of a street lamp. Bearing the scars of war, the once proud soldier symbolizes the fate of Germany itself, broken and defeated. In the foreground, a menacing black dog warns of the dangers that lie ahead. Beckmann further enhances the tension of the scene by crowding his figures into a shallow pictorial space. Above all, The Way Home is a powerful denouncement of war.",

          "description": "This exhibition explores the tragic consequences and incalculable human cost of war and violence. For centuries, artists of various nationalities and points of view have addressed this difficult subject in their work, creating distinctive expressions ranging from virulent anti-war sentiments to frank eyewitness accounts to personal reflections on loss and grief. Drawn primarily from the MIA’s extensive collection of graphic art, the 35 works on display include some of the most compelling representations of war and violence ever created. From Francisco Goya’s renowned Disasters of War etchings to Otto Dix’s infamous Der Krieg (War) portfolio to Daniel Heyman’s powerful portraits of tortured Iraqi War prisoners, the selection shines a bright light on the ravages of war and violence as seen through the eyes and minds of artists. \r\nAlso featured are important graphic works by Honoré Daumier, Käthe Kollwitz, Max Pechstein, Max Beckmann, George Bellows, George Grosz, Pablo Picasso, Jacob Lawrence, David Rathman, Ken Campbell, Stephen Dupont, as well as a major sculptural installation by British contemporary artists Dinos and Jake Chapman.\r\nThis exhibition was organized in conjunction with the museum-sponsored program MIA Inside/Out: Battle of Everyouth, a special one-night event presented as part of the Northern Spark Festival, a citywide celebration of experimental contemporary art in public places. This free program begins at sundown on Saturday, June 4, 2011, on the shared campus of the MIA and Minneapolis College of Art and Design. ",

          "description": "By the early 1900s, people worldwide were transforming their habits, identities, and landscapes more dramatically than ever. Artists and designers, inspired by innovations such as radios, skyscrapers, and even the development of modern psychology, responded with cutting-edge representations of new and familiar subjects.\r\n“International Modernism” explores how this response to modern life evolved through much of the 20th century, from the 1910s through the early 1960s. Installed in stages from fall 2015 through mid-2016, “International Modernism” centers on objects from the Kunin Collection as well as paintings, prints, photography, and design from Mia’s collection.",
